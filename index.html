    <p>A music festival is a community event with performances of singing and instrument playing that is 
       often presented with a theme such as musical genre (e.g., rock, blues, folk, jazz, classical music),
       nationality, locality of musicians, or holiday. Music festivals are generally organized by individuals
       or organizations within networks of music production, typically music scenes, the music industries,
       or institutions of music education.

    <p><div>Music festivals are commonly held outdoors, with tents or roofed temporary stages for the performers.</div> 
        Often music festivals host other attractions such as food and merchandise vending, dance, crafts, 
        performance art, and social or cultural activities. Many festivals are annual, or repeat at some other interval, 
        while some are held only once. Some festivals are organized as for-profit concerts and others are benefits for 
        a specific charitable cause.[3] At music festivals associated with charitable causes, there may be information 
        about social or political issues.

     <p>In my opnion everyone needs to be in at least one time in any festival and experience 
    feelings and sights you have never experienced before.
